# fxtohex

I’m a hands-on engineer passionate about connecting the physical and digital — from embedded systems and radio protocols to immersive virtual worlds.

## What I do

🔌 **Embedded Systems & IoT**  
Writing firmware for ESP32, STM32, nRF, ZephyrOS, rapid prototyping of IoT products and exploring RF techniques.

🚁 **RC/FPV**  
Currently Diving deep into RC systems and existing protocols (ELRS, CrossFire, SRXL2)
- Creating protocol bridges, UART converters, and custom mods
- Looking for low-latency open source digital video solutions ! 

🎮 **VR/AR Development**  
Building immersive experiences for training sims,games and entertainment.

🔒 **Embedded Security**  
Securing IoT devices (and occasionally breaking them)

🖨️ **3D Printing**  
Printing everything — from custom enclosures to weird gadgets. If it breaks, version 2 is already printing.
